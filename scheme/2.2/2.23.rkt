;;; Exercise 2.23
;; The procedure for-each is similar to map. It takes
;; as arguments a procedure and a list of elements.
;; However, rather than forming a list of the results,
;; for-each just applies the procedure to each of the
;; elements in turn, from left to right. The values
;; returned by applying the procedure to the elements
;; are not used at all â€” for-each is used with procedures
;; that perform an action, such as priting. For example,

;; (for-each
;;  (lambda (x) (newline) (display x))
;;  (list 57 321 88))
;;
;; 57
;; 321
;; 88

;; The value returned by the call to for-each
;; (not illustrated above) can be something arbitrary,
;; such as true. Give an implementation of for-each.

(define (for-each f xs)
  (cond ((null? xs) #t)
        (else
         (f (car xs))
         (my-for-each f (cdr xs))))) ; also an iterative process

(define (for-each f xs)
  (define (iter xs acc)
    (if (null? xs)
        #t
        (iter (cdr xs) (f (car xs)))))
  (iter xs #t))
